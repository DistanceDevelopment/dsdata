Converting projects and data
============================

This folder contains scripts to convert the Distance for Windows projects to RData. Some brief descriptions:

- `0-capercaillie.R` builds the capercaillie data, which does not have an associated Distance project (it is a tab-delimited file)
- `1-convert_dst.R` builds the Distance project file-based data sets
